myg is a replacement for iGoogle

It is a sinatra application

provide your exported iGoogle preferences and this will parse it to get set up.

Still in early development.

Todo list:
* Pick a storage engine so we don't have to parse XML all the time
* Pick a storage engine to use to cache fetched RSS/ATOM content
* Pick a front end framework for the frontend -- maybe foundation? This should work on mobile and desktop browsers
* authentication
* once the initial prefs are loaded and stored, provide a way to edit/manage which feeds on which pages
